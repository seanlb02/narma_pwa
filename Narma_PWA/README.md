##Stay connected off-grid with the Narma Network

---

Narma is a one-way messaging app (PWA) intended as a 'similated' support network for people struggling with anxiety, depression and addiction. 

Users build their own narma network . Each narma persona has their own unique background, interests and sense of humor. They like to send all kinds of content to their followers from memes to movie recommendations, tiktoks to local events and everything in between.
